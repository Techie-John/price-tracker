This project is my final project for the ALX Backend Course.

This is what my project is all about. 

# A lot of Nigerians aren't current with the cost of food items. They mostly agree with whatever the seller propose to them.

- Then I thought, why don't I make this a project for my ALX Backend Course and maybe improve it more after wards?

- It basically does two simple things. Scrape Jumia or other marketplace (coming soon), get average costs of these food items, saves it to my database and provide the costs to users via API. 

- As of this commit, there are still a few unfixed bugs but the core functionalities are already setup. The API calls and models for fetching data works fine but users must be authenticated.
